First Job
1. To be or not to be: my journal from a geoscientist to data scientist, a self-intro
2. 2020 is eventful: prepare for the job market at the year end of 2020 
3. Interview is all about personal connection
4. Negotiation is everywhere
5. Thanks to my family, friends, and Insight fellows
6. 2021 is even more eventful. (US Election, granny, company aquisition, company reorg)
